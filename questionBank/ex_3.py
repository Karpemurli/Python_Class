# 3. Write a program that prompts the user to input two integers and outputs the largest.

# First=int(input("Enter a First Number:"))
# Second=int (input("Enter a Second Number:"))



# if First > Second:
#     print("Number is largest:{First}")
# elif Second > First:
#     print("Number is largest:{Second}")
# else:
#     print("Both numbers are equal")
