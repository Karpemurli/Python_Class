# x = None
# print(x)  # Output: None



# def example():

# result = example()
# print(result)  # Output: None



# data = None  # Placeholder
# data = "Python"  # Assign a real value later
# print(data)  # Output: Python


# x = None
# if x is None:
#     print("x has no value")  # Output: x has no value


# print(bool(None))  # Output: False
