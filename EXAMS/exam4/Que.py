# Instructions:
# 1)	All Questions are compulsory.
# 2)	Take all inputs from user.
# 3)	2 marks for each program.
# 4)	Use proper indentation and appropriate comments.

# (Program Section)

# 1)	Write a program to print all-natural numbers upto 100.
# 2)	Write a program to check whether it is Palindrome number or not.
# 3)	Write a program to check whether a number is prime number or not.
# 4)	Write a program to enter any digit number and print its reverse.
# 5)	Given two strings, s1 and s2. Write a program to create a new string s3 made of the first char of s1, then the last char of s2, Next, the second char of s1 and second last char of s2, and so on. Any leftover chars go at the end of the result.
