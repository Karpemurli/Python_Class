Python Array
--------------------
Def : In python array is a collection of items or elements stored in at contiguous memory location. The idea is to store multiple items of the same data type.
- Arrays in python must have all elements of same type.
- Python supports only single dimensional array.
- If you want use 2D array then we use one library/module called as NumPy.

Q. how we can use array in python?
------------------------------------
- If i want to use the array in python first i need to use inbuilt library called as array.

Syntax
-------------
name_variable = array_modulename('typecode',[values])

typecode : typecode is nothing but it is data types like int, float, string. The typecode has the value as below,
a) int ---> i
b) float ---> f
c) string ---> u
d) double --> d

Example -01:
-------------------
import array as arr

myArray = arr.array('i',[10,20,40,50,30])
# by using index we get only one element
print(myArray[0])

# by using slice operator we get multiple elements
print(myArray[0:3])

#by using loop conecept we can also print all elements from array
for i in myArray:
    print(i)


Example -02(change import statement and array declaration)
--------------------------------------------------------------
from array import *
myArray = array('i',[10,20,40,50,30])
# by using index we get only one element
print(myArray[0])

# by using slice operator we get multiple elements
print(myArray[0:3])

#by using loop concept we can also print all elements from array
for i in myArray:
    print(i)


Example -03(Stored float value)
----------------------------------
from array import *  #---> This is called module/library ---> In which multiple classes present
myArray = array('f',[1.12,5.3,6.8,555])

#by using loop concept we can also print all elements from array
for i in myArray:
    print(round(i,2))


How we can access the element of array
---------------------------------------------------
1. print() method
2. by using for loop or while loop.
3. by using index number we can get single element.
4. by using slicing method we get multiple element.

how to take user input
------------------------------
from array import *

#create empty array
myarray = array('i',[])

how_many_element = int(input("Enter how many elements = "))
for i in range(0,how_many_element):
    myarray.append(int(input("Enter the elements = ")))

print("The array elements are below")
for j in myarray:
    print(j)

What are the different methods present in array
--------------------------------------------------------
1. append() : It adds the element at the end of array.
2. insert(index, value) : to insert the element at specific location.
3. count : It determine how many times a particular value present in array.
4. extend: this method is used with array to add element from another array to the end of the array.
5. remove(value) : it remove the value which is present in array.
6. pop() : It remove the last element from array.
7. pop(index) : It removes the specific index value from array.
8. reverse() : reverse the order of the elements.
9. tolist() : convert the array into list.
