Session in Django
==========================
- A session is a way to store the information(data) about user across multiple requests.
- Session allow web applications to track and remember user interactions.
- In django session data is stored on the server side and associated with a unique session ID stored in the    						user's browser(usually as a cookie).

Where we use?
---------------------
1. Login authentication
2. shopping cart
3. Theme change(Dark/light)
4. Language settings

What are the advantages of session?
=========================================
1. Secure : Session data is stored on the server, not exposed to the client.
2. Persistent : Maintains user data across multiple pages until the session expires.
3. Customizable : You can set session expiration time.
